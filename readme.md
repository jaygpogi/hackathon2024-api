## API 
Endpoint: https://hackathonapi20240922091054.azurewebsites.net/

Sample body:
```
{
    "title": "India Budget Management - Assignments Exceeding Budget",
    "description": "The client reported that there is a shortfall of budget for 10 resources whose assignment expired on 4th June 2024. The timesheets submitted for the period of 1st to 4th June should have been rejected by the Beeline system due to budget insufficiency however these timesheets were submitted and approved as well making the Remaining Budget with Non Invoiced Cost go in negative. Attached are the details of the 10 resources."
}
```


# Samples:
- Without results: https://jira.beeline.com/browse/TECH-20752
- Behavioral issue: https://jira.beeline.com/browse/TECH-20749
- Feature not supported: https://jira.beeline.com/browse/TECH-20750
- Specific performance issue: https://jira.beeline.com/browse/TECH-20751

# Future Development
- Figure out a way to consume the API on the new Jira cloud.
- Use Azure AI Language Text Classification to categorize existing indexes for more accuracy. (Assignment, BTE, Reports, etc)
- Declare a "bias" list of phrases to eliminate any non-related texts. 
- Right now this uses BM25 search algorithm which depends on term frequency. Ideally, this should use semantic ranking logic that also understands contexts (but needs higher tier account) for more accurate results.
- We fill out the Status Summary Jira field of resolved inquiry tickets. This field indicates the problem, investigation, and recommendation. A new POST endpoint can be developed that can push new records on the search index based on this field if nothing is retrieved for a ticket. Tags can be generated by extraction and use the "bias" list for more accuracy.
